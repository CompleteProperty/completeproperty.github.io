            experience that have enabled us to build such an impressive portfolio. How have we achieved this stellar track record?

            Late delivery of work is simply unacceptable. In fact, in 25+ years of our history, we can proudly say that we have never missed a completion date due to issues that are within our control! Our principal executive personally oversees and manages weekly
            project reviews for every single one of our clients where time, budget, safety and quality are regularly and consistently monitored.

            We hold ourselves accountable! Our clients know that they can count on us even under the tightest time frames. We never take shortcuts and refuse to place profits over our client’s best interests and over the safety of our team.

            Construction projects do not always unfold in a linear fashion and at Complete Property Services we have the experience to meet any challenges that may arise. Proper planning and open communications with our clients and team members enable us to handle
            highly demanding and technical projects with complete success.
