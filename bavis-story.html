            Our leadership team is second generation, as are many of our employees.  When you create a trusting, caring and committed work environment, employees become excellent recruiters for top talent.  When Norman Bavis met Rick Krueger in 1990, he never expected that he would still be working at the same company today.  “Back in those days, everyone knew everyone. We were only 20 people—today we are over 275 employees nationwide and the same family environment exists” recalls Norman.  As the company grew, so did the opportunities for our employees, and in this case their families. Norman further states, “Rick brought his sons up through CPS, same as I did.  Michael actually worked for me on a crew when he first started with the company.  Rick and Hank are honest men, the same is true for Michael and Matt. CPS has always been there for its employees, so it was easy to say yes when my son, Jonathan, wanted to work at Complete Property too.”  Jonathan recalls growing up and helping his father on projects from an early age.  Before long, Jonathan was hired, trained and was one of the youngest exterior crew managers working in the Tampa market. Today, Jonathan leads our exterior crews in the same market, still working alongside his father Norman on certain projects.
