            Safety plays a fundamental role in our company and itâ€™s our absolute commitment. Our safety policy is much more than just a per-project implementation or a per-site consideration: it is a way of life that has become part of our corporate fabric and is at the forefront of all our initiatives.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Our zero tolerance philosophy starts right at the very top with our leadership and works all the way through to our field personnel and subcontractors. Our Loss Control policies have been derived from the wisdom and experience of our professional staff along with our associates in the industry.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Our personnel are trained to be proactive when it comes to safety and have learned to deal with potential problems before they arise. All of our projects are inspected daily making sure that we are always in compliance with OSHA and ANSI standards. All of our sub-contractors must sign our Corporate Safety Policy, as part of their contact and are held to the same standards as our own personnel.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            It is our ethical and moral responsibility to ensure the safety of our personnel, partners and clients. Making sure that at the end of the day everyone goes home safe.
