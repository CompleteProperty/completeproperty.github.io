          Our Specialty Contracting Division allows CPS to provide a "turn-key" alternative when customers are facing unique challenges such as environmental issues, catastrophic events, complete building overhauls, troubled projects in need of recovery.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          Challenging projects are a strong suit for us at CPS.  We enjoy the challenge these unique projects provide.  Working in partnership with our clients, architects and consultants, we are able to develop solutions and schedules to make what seems impossible, possible.

          “You have an incredible team.  They are some of the most professional, dedicated, and committed guys I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Never once have I ever asked for something to be done and it was anything other than "yes". If I asked for an update it was always a direct, accurate and honest evaluation. If one of them made a mistake they stood right up, took responsibly and immediately worked to resolve the issue. I know this is a direct result of knowing they have 100% support and empowerment. Through the course of this project, one of the tougher I've been a part of, they have each been a pleasure to work with.”
